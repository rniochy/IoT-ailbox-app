# IOT Mailbox Simulator

The objective of the IOT Mailbox Simulator is to mimic how an Internet of Things
(IOT) enabled physical mailbox might be used to notify you when "snail" mail 
has arrived. In doing so it will provide you with experience using callbacks
to communicate state between different components of an app that are dependent
on one another.
